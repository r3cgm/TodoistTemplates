If you have a lot of entries in Todoist for things you want to watch consider using the following ChatGPT template to help you organize them.

This template will:
- Look up and average the rating across Metacritic, Rotten Tomatoes, and IMDb
- Show the individual ratings too in the description so you can infer from the Critics vs. Public ratings in Rotten Tomatoes for example
- Show direct URLs you can click on to watch the video
- Look up the rental cost for watching it
- Preserve any personal notes you took such as who gave this video a recommendation in the first place

Tell ChatGPT to use this template format and let it do the rest.  Copy/paste the first line of output into Todoist as the title, and the rest as the description:
