# Introduction

Improve your Todoist entries for video recommendations and to-watch lists!

If you have a lot of entries in Todoist for things you want to see, consider using the following ChatGPT template to help you organize them.

This template will:

- Look up and average the rating across Metacritic, Rotten Tomatoes, and IMDb
- Show the individual ratings too in the description so you can infer from the Critics vs. Public ratings in Rotten Tomatoes for example
- Show direct URLs you can click on to watch the video
- Look up the rental cost for watching it
- Preserve any personal notes you took such as who gave this video a recommendation in the first place

# Usage
